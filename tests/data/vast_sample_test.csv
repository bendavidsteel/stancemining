India,"No one can ever truly afford to have a child. Mankind would have died out eons ago if we'd all waited. But then we lived VERY modestly on one income so we had no child care expenses. Anyone who graduates from college with 6 figure student loans is a fool - there are ways to get a college education without doing that. I agree that those with only a high school diploma absolutely must delay children until they achieve some financial stability - if they don't, they'll have a lifetime of poverty. But all these college-educated young who are delaying parenthood until their forties so they can obtain all the material things they desire and take all the trips are only fooling themselves.
