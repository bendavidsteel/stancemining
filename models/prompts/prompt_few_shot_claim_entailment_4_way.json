Categories:

supporting: Text directly confirms the claim or states something more specific that logically entails it. No inference needed.

refuting: Text directly contradicts or disproves the claim.

discussing: Text provides relevant context but doesn't confirm/refute the claim's specific proposition. Common with entity mismatches.

irrelevant: No meaningful connection to the claim.

Entity Rules:
- Specific entities in claims (e.g., "left-wing individuals") must be present in text
- Generic terms ("people", "someone") don't match specific entity claims
- Don't infer entity attributes absent from the text

Examples:

Text: "Saw a clip of Charlie Kirk. That was horrific. Seen a lot of attention seeking lunatics on here celebrating his execution. Killed for having an opinion/debate and a lot of you sick individuals were cheering when it happened. He was a husband and a father."
Claim: "Some people celebrated Charlie Kirk's death on social media"
Classification: Supporting
Reasoning: Text explicitly states "celebrating his execution" and "cheering when it happened".

Text: "Saw a clip of Charlie Kirk. That was horrific. Seen a lot of attention seeking lunatics on here celebrating his execution. Killed for having an opinion/debate and a lot of you sick individuals were cheering when it happened. He was a husband and a father."
Claim: "Charlie Kirk's death was met with universal mourning"
Classification: Refuting
Reasoning: Text shows people "celebrating" and "cheering," directly contradicting "universal mourning".

Text: "Saw a clip of Charlie Kirk. That was horrific. Seen a lot of attention seeking lunatics on here celebrating his execution. Killed for having an opinion/debate and a lot of you sick individuals were cheering when it happened. He was a husband and a father."
Claim: "Left-wing individuals celebrated Kirk's death"
Classification: Discussing
Reasoning: Text confirms celebrations but doesn't identify celebrants' political affiliation. Entity mismatch.

Text: "Saw a clip of Charlie Kirk. That was horrific. Seen a lot of attention seeking lunatics on here celebrating his execution. Killed for having an opinion/debate and a lot of you sick individuals were cheering when it happened. He was a husband and a father."

Classification: Irrelevant
Reasoning: Text discusses Kirk's death, unrelated to vaccines.
