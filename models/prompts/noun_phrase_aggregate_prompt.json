        "You are an expert at analyzing and categorizing topics.",
        """Your task is to generate a list of appropriately specific generalized stance targets that best represent a cluster of related stance targets.

        Instructions:
        1. Review the provided stance targets and keyphrases that characterize the stance target cluster
        2. Identify the common specific stance issues these targets relate to
        3. Generate 1-3 appropriately specific noun phrases that:
        - Are specific enough to meaningfully represent the stance being taken
        - Are general enough to apply to the whole cluster
        - Include relevant context like policy domains, affected groups, or implementation approaches
        - Each noun phrase should be max 5 words
        - If inputs are low quality (just emojis, Twitter handles, random phrases), return []

        Input:
        Representative stance targets: [list of stance targets]
        Top keyphrases: [list of high tf-idf terms]

        Output format:
        Generalized target: ["appropriately specific noun phrase 1", "appropriately specific noun phrase 2", "appropriately specific noun phrase 3"]
        Reasoning: [1-2 sentences explaining why these specific generalizations fit]

        Examples:

        Input:
        Representative stance targets: ["EU vaccine passports", "mandatory covid shots", "provincial immunization requirements"]
        Top keyphrases: ["mandatory", "requirement", "public health", "immunization", "vaccination"]

        Output:
        Generalized target: ["mandatory healthcare worker vaccination", "cross-border vaccination verification", "regional immunization requirements"]
        Reasoning: These capture specific vaccination contexts and policy approaches across different regional systems without overly precise details.

        Input:
        Representative stance targets: ["London congestion charge", "Oslo car-free zones", "Paris emissions restrictions"]
        Top keyphrases: ["emissions", "electric vehicles", "urban", "pollution"]

        Output:
        Generalized target: ["urban vehicle restriction zones", "metropolitan emissions policies", "city center traffic regulations"]
        Reasoning: These targets identify specific urban policy approaches across different cities and implementation contexts without committing to exact timeframes.

        Input:
        Representative stance targets: ["o canada", "canada #canada", "2/3 of canadians", "canada 🍁", "canada canadians"]
        Top keyphrases: ["canadians", "canada", "canadas", "canadian", "canadianpolling", "screwed", "canadaus", "broken"]

        Output:
        Generalized target: ["canada", "current state of canada"]
        Reasoning: The inputs are all basically just the stance target canada, so output that and a related target.

        Input:
        Representative stance targets: ["content moderation", "online censorship", "platform guidelines"]
        Top keyphrases: ["social media", "guidelines", "content", "moderation", "posts"]

        Output:
        Generalized target: ["political content removal policies", "international platform regulations", "global speech moderation standards"]
        Reasoning: These specify content types and regulatory mechanisms across international contexts without naming specific platforms or exact policies.

        Input:
        Representative stance targets: ["Mediterranean migration crisis", "Canadian immigration system", "Schengen border controls"]
        Top keyphrases: ["migration", "borders", "refugees", "policy", "asylum"]

        Output:
        Generalized target: ["refugee processing protocols", "international border management", "asylum application systems"]
        Reasoning: These targets specify aspects of migration management across different regions without overly specific geographic or numerical details.

        Input:
        Representative stance targets: ["Ontario teacher contracts", "Ontario education spending", "Ontario school funding"]
        Top keyphrases: ["education", "funding", "teachers", "schools", "budget"]

        Output:
        Generalized target: ["Ontario public education funding models", "Ontario teacher collective agreements", "Ontario classroom resource availability"]
        Reasoning: These identify specific aspects of education funding for the Canadian province of Ontario without committing to specific percentage increases or exact amounts.

        Input:
        Representative stance targets: ["😂😂😂", "@JohnDoe2023", "@RealUserXYZ", "lol omg"]
        Top keyphrases: ["lol", "omg", "user", "haha"]

        Output:
        Generalized target: []
        Reasoning: The inputs contain only emojis, specific Twitter usernames, and generic expressions without substantive content related to any stance target.

        Representative stance targets: ["just saying", "idk maybe", "whatever", "cool story"]
        Top keyphrases: ["just", "maybe", "whatever", "cool", "story"]

        Output:
        Generalized target: ["jagmeet singh", "jagmeet singh's policies", "jagmeet singh's leadership"]
